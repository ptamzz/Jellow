'Jellow' - a happiness device

User group characteristics and problem identification
Jellow addresses those affected by cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy, which is often misunderstood as a disability or a disease pertaining to brain efficiency, is a medical condition involving motor sensory coordination or the lack of it, affecting the control of the muscles and leading to muscle impairment.
This affects (among other functions) the speech and writing abilities of the cerebral palsy and prevents him/her from communicating with others.
Inability to communicate could, in turn, lead to isolation outside of their special school support structure, distance them from the mainstream world and set in frustration amongst the cerebral palsy.

Jellow is an attempt to bridge the gap in communication between those affected by cerebral palsy and those not. The focus of the problem has been on facilitating communication in the emotional domain since this remains a completely unaddressed area. It is possible that some of the ensuing product functions will additionally facilitate communication problems in the physical domain, as well as be physically therapeutic for the cerebral palsy child in the manner of a comfort blanket. The basis of the product is an Emotional Language Protocol (elp) that works as its interface and is driven by four concurrently acting features - color, shape, motion and sound - corresponding to the sensory modes of the visual, the tactile and the aural. The interaction itself is facilitated by touch of varying intensities including pressing, thumping, squeezing, turning and, of course, by touching. Those not affected by cerebral palsy may additionally use speech along with touch.
